# Image Captioning with Flickr30k Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for an Image Captioning project using the Flickr30k dataset. The goal of this project is to generate descriptive captions for images by leveraging a deep learning model. The model combines a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for generating captions.

## Project Overview

### 1. Model Architecture
The image captioning model is built using a combination of a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN and an LSTM-based RNN:
- **ResNet-50 CNN**: A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is employed to extract rich and meaningful features from the input images. This CNN is known for its ability to capture intricate details and patterns in images, making it ideal for this task.
- **LSTM RNN**: The extracted features from the CNN are then fed into an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, which is used to generate captions sequentially. The LSTM network is designed to handle the temporal dependencies in the sequence of words that form the image caption.

### 2. Image Captioning Pipeline
An end-to-end image captioning pipeline was developed to efficiently generate captions for images:
- **Feature Extraction**: The pipeline begins with the extraction of image features using the pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
- **Caption Generation**: These features are then input into the LSTM network to generate a caption for the image.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The model was fine-tuned specifically on the Flickr30k dataset to enhance its ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions.

### 3. Dataset and Preprocessing
The Flickr30k dataset, which contains 30,000 images each paired with five descriptive captions, was used to train and validate the model. To ensure the quality and consistency of the generated captions, several preprocessing steps were employed:
- **Tokenization**: The NLTK library was used to tokenize the captions, breaking them down into individual words.


### 4. Model Performance
The model's performance was evaluated using the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, a standard metric for assessing the quality of machine-generated text against reference text:
- **BLEU Score**: The model achieved an average BLEU score of 0.41 on the validation dataset, indicating that the generated captions were fairly accurate and closely matched the human-provided captions.
